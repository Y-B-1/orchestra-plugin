# Changelog

Release 2.0.0 is described in docs/RELEASE-NOTES-2.0.0.md.

## 2.1.0 — 2026-10-05

- Claude-native only. Removed the Codex package (`plugins/orchestra-codex`), `.agents`, the Codex manifest and hook file, the generated worker profiles, `install-profiles` and `uninstall-profiles`, and every Codex path in the engine, hooks and generator. `config/models.json` keeps only the claude profile. Claude roles, models and efforts are unchanged; `agents/*.md` are byte-identical to 2.0.1.
- Stricter Git guard, in both the Python guard and the TypeScript mod, kept in parity by the shared corpus: every `git stash` form is denied (including `list` and `show`); wholesale `git add` is denied (`-A`, `-u`, `--all`, `--update`, `--no-ignore-removal`, short clusters with `A` or `u`, and the pathspecs `.`, `./`, `..`, `../`, `:/`, `:/.` and `*`); `git commit -a`, `--all` and clusters with `a` are denied. Commit messages that merely mention these words stay allowed.
- Docs and skill references rewritten for Claude only. Historical records are unchanged.

## 2.0.1 — 2026-10-04

- Claude `PreToolUse` matcher now includes `Agent` and `Task` (`Bash|Edit|Write|MultiEdit|Agent|Task`), so workers cannot delegate in Claude Code. This supersedes the 2.0.0 note that the matcher covered only `Bash|Edit|Write|MultiEdit`.
- Test: `_MOD_TOOLS` in `orchestra_core/hooks.py` must equal `GUARDED` in `hooks/mod/orchestra.ts`, so the two lists cannot drift apart.
