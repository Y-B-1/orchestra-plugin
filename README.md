# Orchestra

Orchestra packages a main coordinator and six worker roles for Claude Code. It routes work into lanes, dispatches ready independent cards, reviews returned work, and checks evidence before release. No classifier API key, daemon or Charge installation is needed. Version 2.0.0 was a breaking release; see [release notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-2.0.0.md). Version 2.1.0 is Claude-native only and tightens the Git guard; see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The role count does not limit useful concurrency. Multiple instances of the same role can run on disjoint files and resources. The portable core defaults to 20 workers; actual harness limits and machine capacity still apply.

## Install

Prerequisites: Python 3.11 or later, Git, and Claude Code. Native checks used Claude Code 2.1.289. Windows is not supported by the POSIX locking core; use WSL. Other harnesses can use the portable CLI and contracts but need their own native adapter, which this repository does not ship.

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add Y-B-1/orchestra-plugin
claude plugin install orchestra@orchestra-distribution
```

Restart the client after installation. Enable the plugin and review its hook definition in the native trust interface; installation does not grant trust. Once enabled and trusted, startup supplies the main coordinator contract. The plugin's default main agent follows your model and effort picker. Explicit user or managed settings can override defaults.

No installer changes application instructions, restores symlinks, resumes old work, grants release rights or writes hook trust. Existing project rules remain applicable. Port a project's old Orchestra enforcement separately to avoid competing coordinators.

### Upgrade from 2.4 to 2.5

A run started under 2.4 loads under 2.5 and keeps item routing; new runs use `--size`; `--items` is refused on `start`. Do not resume a 2.5 run with a 2.4 engine: 2.4 loads it without a routing check.

### Upgrade from 2.3 to 2.4

A run started under 2.3 loads under 2.4 when its policy is unchanged: `status`, `interrupt` and `finish` work, and its first write rebinds it to 2.4, after which 2.3 refuses it, so do not mix versions on one run. It keeps 2.3 routing, since it has no `--items`: no route check, and every review category is required. A queued `code-reviewer` checkpoint card no longer dispatches, because 2.4 removed that mode. A policy or role change made while a run is active is still refused: end that run with the version that started it, or move its `state.json` out of the state directory. A new run needs `start --items N`. Gate and review receipts recorded under 2.3 go stale under 2.4, because the evidence binds the policy hash: rerun the gate and the pre-PR review before `finish`.

### Upgrade from 2.1 to 2.2

A run started under 2.1 loads under 2.2: its cards, reviews, gates and armed autonomy carry over, `max_passes` and `max_stalls` in its ledger are recorded and no longer enforced, and queued builder cards dispatch without Keep and Remove headings. Do not mix versions on one active run. A 2.1 engine rejects a `held` card and an armed autonomy without `max_passes`, and the 2.1 hooks then fail closed for that run. End every 2.1 session before the first `hold` or before arming under 2.2.

The downstream shell relaunch harness no longer works against 2.x. `orchestra.py relaunch` replaces it (see Autonomous mode).

### Upgrade from 1.0.1

A 1.0.1 run that was finished or interrupted leaves the repository unarmed under 2.0.0. Plain `start` and `status` then say to run `start --new-run`, which archives the old state and starts a fresh run.

A run left active across the upgrade is different. Old role names are rejected, so a live 1.0.1 run cannot continue, and 2.0.0 cannot clear it: its policy hash differs, so `interrupt`, `finish` and `start --new-run` all refuse it. End it with 1.0.1 first, from its repository, with 1.0.1 still installed. Claude Code: `python3.11 ~/.claude/plugins/cache/orchestra-distribution/orchestra/1.0.1/scripts/orchestra.py --lease LEASE interrupt` (or `finish`). LEASE is the value `start` printed; if you lost it, the same script's `status` prints the state, and the lease is `session.lease` in that output. If you already upgraded with a run active, move that run's `state.json` out of the state directory by hand; the repository is then unarmed. 1.0.1 has no `where` command; after installing 2.0.0, run its `orchestra.py where` from the repository to print the state directory, or compute the path yourself. It is `$ORCHESTRA_STATE_DIR` when set, otherwise `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/orchestra/<id>`, where `<id>` is the first 24 hex characters of the SHA-256 of the repository's absolute path. Then reinstall from the marketplace and restart the client.

```sh
claude plugin uninstall orchestra@orchestra-distribution
claude plugin marketplace remove orchestra-distribution
claude plugin marketplace add Y-B-1/orchestra-plugin
claude plugin install orchestra@orchestra-distribution
claude plugin list
```

### Install a checkout first

To run a build from a local clone before it is published, install it the same way and restart. A marketplace name can exist only once, so remove the installed one first. Installing the new version first matters for releases: the 2.0.0 guard allows an ordinary non-force push and pull request merge outside an armed run, which the 1.0.1 guard denied.

```sh
claude plugin uninstall orchestra@orchestra-distribution
claude plugin marketplace remove orchestra-distribution
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/orchestra-plugin
claude plugin install orchestra@orchestra-distribution
claude plugin list
```

Orchestra hooks are absent between uninstall and install, so run these in a plain terminal rather than from an Orchestra-guarded session. `claude plugin list` must show exactly one `orchestra@orchestra-distribution`.

### Mods and function hooks

On Claude Code the plugin also registers a function-hook module that classifies commands in process, adds `/orchestra-board` and `/orchestra-autonomy`, and shows toasts and a status band. It needs a Claude Code build with function hooks enabled (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1`) and the `$` APIs the module uses; it is tested on Claude Code 2.1.289 (CLI) and 2.1.286 (embedded in Desktop with that variable set). There is no version floor and no explicit API check: if a needed API is missing, session start fails, the guard stays not ready, and guarded calls fall back to the Python hooks. In that case, and with function hooks off, the Python hooks do the same guarding and the CLI does everything else. See [hook policy](docs/hooks.md).

## Roles and models

[Role contracts](docs/roles.md) describe responsibilities and the v1 to v2 mapping. [Model matrix](docs/models.md) lists model and effort settings. The coordinator runs in the main session and never as a worker. The six worker roles are investigator, designer-planner, critic, builder, code-reviewer and operator; each role has one skill and loads one mode file for its brief's `Mode:` line. The generator produces 10 Claude worker agents plus the orchestrator.

One pre-PR review covers the integrated candidate. Correctness is always a lens; security applies when a changed file matches policy `sensitive_paths`; standards and cleanup apply above `standards_min_lines` changed lines. A critic runs a separate pass for each needed conformance axis. The operator runs actual commands and executes only a configured authorized release. A reviewer cannot approve their own work.

| v1 role | v2 role and mode |
| --- | --- |
| orchestrator | orchestrator / main |
| investigator, investigator-code | investigator / docs, code |
| founder-mind (design) | designer-planner / product |
| founder-mind (audit) | critic / surface |
| designer-planner | designer-planner / design, plan |
| red-teamer | critic / requirements, feasibility, scope, judge |
| auditor | critic / spec, standards, ledger |
| builder | builder / implementation, frontend, sensitive, mechanical |
| builder-repair | builder / repair |
| code-reviewer, code-reviewer-checkpoint | code-reviewer / final |
| gatekeeper | operator / gate |
| janitor | operator / cleanup |
| releaser | operator / release |

## Run the workflow

Read [the CLI guide](docs/cli.md) for commands and the package [CLI reference](plugins/orchestra/skills/orchestra/references/cli.md) for task and review schemas. Run state lives under the user state directory, outside the application checkout. The core enforces dependencies, reservations, capacity, lifecycle and evidence freshness; the coordinator supplies semantic facts and checks findings.

```sh
python3.11 plugins/orchestra/scripts/orchestra.py --repo /path/to/project start --size medium
python3.11 plugins/orchestra/scripts/orchestra.py --repo /path/to/project board
```

Release is disabled by default. Explicit project policy names authorization, exact remote, target, commands and required checks. Configuring Orchestra never grants permission beyond the user's instructions. Outside an armed run, ordinary pushes and pull request merges are not gated by a permit; inside one they need the engine permit. Native hooks cover supported tool calls and recognizable commands; they are not a sandbox for arbitrary scripts or hostile workers.

### Autonomous mode

`orchestra.py autonomy arm|disarm|status|settle` (on Claude, `/orchestra-autonomy on|off|status`) lets the run continue unattended within a written ledger of goal, completion checks and a deadline. The deadline is the only limit: no count of passes or stalls stops the run. Release, push, merge, deletion and credential entry are hard boundaries: the coordinator parks the card and continues with other cards. The one exception is a `- Release: pre-authorized <remote> <target>` line that matches the configured policy release. A run brief lands in the run's `progress.md` at every end of a run, shows at the next session start and prints with `orchestra.py brief`. See the [CLI guide](docs/cli.md).

For fresh context on every pass, arm with `autonomy arm --relaunch`, end the interactive session, and run `orchestra.py relaunch --permission-mode MODE [--model ID]` in a terminal. It runs one `claude -p` pass at a time, ends each pass's session, backs off after a stalled pass and never stops for stalls. It replaces the downstream shell harness.

### Routing, repair and hold

`start --size tiny|medium [--asks N]` sizes the run by the diff it will produce: tiny (up to 50 changed lines) stays in the main session, with `dispatch --helper REASON` for a helper; medium (up to 400) grills inline, then runs builders, 2+ units through Workflow; large is reached only with `route --size large` or an owner request, and maps the work before a plan card. `prepr` warns when the diff outgrows the budget and names the pre-PR reviewer. Builders end with one `SELF_REVIEW:` line. Review happens once, before the PR. A failed card gets one Opus repair and one fix re-review (`repair_check: true`); a chain still blocked after the fix re-review is held for the owner with `orchestra.py hold TASK --finding TEXT`. `route`, `prepr`, `finding add|list` and `gate --again` are in the [CLI guide](docs/cli.md).

## Check and distribute

```sh
python3.11 -m unittest discover -s tests

```

[Source comparison](docs/source-parity.md), [hook policy](docs/hooks.md), and [validation evidence](docs/VALIDATION.md) record what was preserved, changed, checked and not established. GitHub supplies an installable marketplace and release archives. Public directory listing requires a separate host submission; publishing this repository does not claim marketplace approval.

MIT license covers the original package code and instructions. Skill files derive in part from MIT-licensed sources credited in `plugins/orchestra/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`. Private source snapshots and application history are not distributed.
